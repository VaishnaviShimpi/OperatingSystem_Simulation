# Multiprogramming Operating System Simulation

This project provides a basic implementation of how an Operating System works to carry out various tasks. The algorithm helps in understanding various functionalities of the Operating System, including:

1. Interpretation of low-level language by the Operating System.
2. How the Operating System inserts data into memory for execution.
3. The role of the Operating System in error handling.
4. The role of the Operating System in memory management and page fault handling.

## Overview

In this project, we have low-level input files which include program cards, control cards, and data cards. The data cards contain the actual data to be uploaded to memory, while the program cards instruct the OS on what to do with the data. Control cards are used to manage the flow of the algorithm.

## Phases

The project is implemented in 2 phases:

### Phase 1

In the first phase, the main focus is on understanding data handling and how the operating system loads data into memory or registers with the help of instructions provided by the program cards.

### Phase 2

In the second phase, memory management is addressed, and interrupts are introduced into the input files. The algorithm helps us understand how the operating system handles these interrupts and performs memory management to handle complex inputs.

## Implementation

To implement this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. For Phase 1, use the input file "Phase1InputFile.txt". Run the Java file, and view the output in the "Phase1OutputFile.txt" file.
3. For Phase 2, use the input file "Phase2InputFile.txt". Run the Java file, and view the output in the "Phase2OutputFile.txt" file.
4. To understand the input file structure, refer to the "inputFileData.txt" file.
